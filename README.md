## ABOUT ME
Completed Master of Applied Science (M.A.Sc.) degree with specialization in Network Economics and Optimization of Cloud/Edge Computing Networks from The University of British Columbia.

I love to dig into the applications of Mathematical Optimization algorithms in our daily lives. During my research, I worked on addressing critical issues of joint pricing and service placement problem in edge computing resulting from the heterogeneity and limited capacities of edge resources. 

To accomplish my research objectives,  I majorly focused on bilevel optimization framework and customized column-and-constraint generation method from the adaptive robust optimization literature to solve the integer bi-level model. 

Areas of interest: 
Mathematical modeling, multi-agent systems, operations research, network economics, game theory, market design, distributed optimization and fairness with applications in Cloud/edge computing, computer networking, Internet of Things, Wireless communication systems, smart grids, demand response, electric vehicles and renewable energy integration, to name a few.

I enjoy working in team, hearing innovative ideas, critical thinking and exploring new methodologies.  I'm looking forward to acquiring more hands-on experience and knowledge!
