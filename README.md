## ABOUT ME
Experienced Data Scientist with a knack for blending statistical modeling with business analytics to drive impactful insights. Completed Master of Applied Science (M.A.Sc.) degree with specialization in Network Economics and Optimization of Cloud/Edge Computing Networks from The University of British Columbia.

Proficient in multiple coding platforms including Python, SQL and experienced in predictive modeling, time series forecasting, clustering, and more. I have also collaborated with front-end teams on crafting visually compelling dashboards using tools like Tableau and dash plotly, empowering stakeholders with actionable insights for strategic planning.

Areas of interest: 
Mathematical modeling, multi-agent systems, operations research, data processing, data analysis, data visualization, network economics, game theory, market design, AI/ML modeling and more.

I enjoy working in team, hearing innovative ideas, critical thinking and exploring new methodologies!

### 4. [Joint Resource Management and Pricing in Edge Computing](https://github.com/tnisha67/Masters-Thesis)
**Problem Formulation**:  We formulate the interaction between the platform (i.e., the leader) and the services (i.e., the followers) as a bilevel program which consists of an  upper-level optimization problem and *K* lower-level  problems, each for one service. The platform solves the upper-level problem to maximize its profit, and then announces the resource prices and service placement decisions to the services.

**Comparison between dynamic, flat, and average pricing schemes**: The dynamic pricing scheme (Dyn) is the proposed model where the resource prices at the edge nodes (ENs) can be different to balance supply and demand. In the flat pricing scheme (Flat), we solve the same bilevel model with an extra constraint in the leader problem that enforces the resource prices at all the ENs to be equal. In the average pricing scheme (Avg), the unit resource prices at the ENs are the same, which are simply set to the average value in  the set of possible prices.
