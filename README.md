## ABOUT ME
Completed Master of Applied Science (M.A.Sc.) degree with specialization in Network Economics and Optimization of Cloud/Edge Computing Networks from The University of British Columbia.

I love to dig into the applications of Mathematical Optimization algorithms in our daily lives. During my research, I worked on addressing critical issues of joint pricing and service placement problem in edge computing resulting from the heterogeneity and limited capacities of edge resources. 

To accomplish my research objectives,  I majorly focused on bilevel optimization framework and customized column-and-constraint generation method from the adaptive robust optimization literature to solve the integer bi-level model. 

Areas of interest: 
Mathematical modeling, multi-agent systems, operations research, network economics, game theory, market design, distributed optimization and fairness with applications in Cloud/edge computing, computer networking, Internet of Things, Wireless communication systems, smart grids, demand response, electric vehicles and renewable energy integration, to name a few.

I enjoy working in team, hearing innovative ideas, critical thinking and exploring new methodologies.  I'm looking forward to acquiring more hands-on experience and knowledge!

### 4. [Joint Resource Management and Pricing in Edge Computing](https://github.com/tnisha67/Masters-Thesis)
**Problem Formulation**:  We formulate the interaction between the platform (i.e., the leader) and the services (i.e., the followers) as a bilevel program which consists of an  upper-level optimization problem and *K* lower-level  problems, each for one service. The platform solves the upper-level problem to maximize its profit, and then announces the resource prices and service placement decisions to the services.

**Comparison between dynamic, flat, and average pricing schemes**: The dynamic pricing scheme (Dyn) is the proposed model where the resource prices at the edge nodes (ENs) can be different to balance supply and demand. In the flat pricing scheme (Flat), we solve the same bilevel model with an extra constraint in the leader problem that enforces the resource prices at all the ENs to be equal. In the average pricing scheme (Avg), the unit resource prices at the ENs are the same, which are simply set to the average value in  the set of possible prices.
